#Generating Shitposts based on FB feed
This project drew inspiration from https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model
1) Use fb2csv.py to extract FB archive data. If you go under your facebook settings you can request for an archive of your facebook posts. Request to download. Once done, unzip. You will want to look for timeline.htm to extract your post information
